Flash Atom
==========

Flash Atom is an idea similar to SDSC's Flash Gordon system where instead of expensive solid state disks to use as scratch space, Flash Atom will use available system memory as the scratch space. System memory is faster and requires no hardware costs. Flash Atom is ideal for large compute nodes that can spare double/triple digit system memory for ramdisk. Currently used at University of California, Irvine on its HPC cluster.
